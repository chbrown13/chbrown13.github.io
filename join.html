            <p style="padding-left:15px;padding-right:5px">I am excited to work with Virginia Tech students (undergraduate, Masters, or PhD) interested in conducting impactful software engineering research. 
			Our research approach involves performing empirical studies to characterize software engineering problems and developing tools and techniques to overcome these issues. Overall, we aim to be a diverse team of researchers producing
			<a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1194">outward	facing research</a> in software engineering through the exploration of cutting edge 
			tools, current trends in society, and interdiscplinary research. Our work integrates fields such as human-computer interaction, CS education, behavioral science, and psychology
			into software engineering.

			</p>

			<p style="padding-left:15px;padding-right:5px">The <a href="lab.html">research page</a> lists projects and studies we are currently working on in the lab. However, if you would like to propose your own
				work I am often	open to supporting new and creative ideas within software engineering. I generally require a prior relationship (i.e. take my class, TA my class, independent study, etc.)
				before adding students to determine if working together will be mutually beneficial for the research team and your personal goals.
			
			</p>
            
			<p style="padding-left:15px;padding-right:5px">Virginia Tech has the <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&us" target="_blank">#15 ranked</a> software engineering research program in the US! If you are a potential
			graduate student, consider applying to VT for your <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Degrees/Doctorate.html">PhD</a> or <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Degrees/MSThesis.html">MS</a>
			degree. If you are a current or future VT student, please send me an email (dcbrown at vt.edu) with the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An introduction to yourself: Who are you? Where are you from? What are you passionate about? What are your goals?</li>
                <li>Research is about telling a story. What story do you want to tell? What is an aspect of software engineering that that excites you? Which active project(s) would
					you be interested in working on? Or propose your own project!
				</li>
				<li>What skills do you have? Please send a copy of your CV, resume, outline of your experience, or a cool project you've worked on.</li>
				<li>Are you available for a meeting? Feel free to come by my office hours or we can schedule a time to meet (virtual or in-person) and chat.</li>
				<em><li style="color:#800000; list-style-type:square;"><b>Please note, I apologize in advance for any delays in my response.</b></em>
