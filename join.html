            <h4><b>Interested in Joining?</b></h4>

            <p style="padding-left:15px;padding-right:5px">I am excited to work with Virginia Tech students (undergraduate, MS, or PhD) interested in conducting impactful software engineering research. 
			Our research approach involves performing empirical studies to characterize problems in software engineering and using interdisciplinary
			techniques and developing automated tools to overcome these issues. Overall, we aim to be a diverse team of researchers producing
			<a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1194">outward	facing research</a> in software engineering through the exploration of cutting edge 
			tools and current trends in society. More information about the <code><b style="color: navy">Code World, No Blanket</code></b> research group is available 
			<a href="https://code-world-no-blanket.github.io/about.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<p style="padding-left:15px;padding-right:5px">The <a href="https://code-world-no-blanket.github.io/research.html">research webpage</a> lists projects and studies we are currently working on in the lab. However, if you would like to propose your own
				work we are always open to supporting new and creative ideas to improve problems in software engineering. I generally require a prior relationship with students (i.e. take my class, TA for my class, complete an independent study, etc.)
				before admitting them into the group. This is to determine whether we can work together well and if our partnership will be mutually beneficial for our research objectives and your personal goals.
			
			</p>
            
			<p style="padding-left:15px;padding-right:5px">Virginia Tech has the <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&us" target="_blank">15th ranked</a> 
			software engineering research program in the US! If you are a potential
			graduate student, check out <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/research/research-areas/software-engineering.html" target="_blank">software engineering at VT</a> and consider applying to 
			Virginia Tech for your <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Degrees/Doctorate.html">PhD</a> or <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/Graduate/Degrees/MSThesis.html">MS</a>
			degree. To apply to join our group, please send me an email (dcbrown at vt.edu) with the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An introduction to yourself: Who are you? Where are you from? What are you passionate about? What are your goals?</li>
                <li>Research is about telling a story. What story do you want to tell? What is an aspect of software engineering that that excites you? Which active project(s) would
					you be interested in working on? Or propose your own project!
				</li>
				<li>What skills do you have? Please send a copy of your CV, resume, outline of your experience, or a cool project you've worked on.</li>
				<li>Are you available for a meeting? Feel free to come by my office hours or we can schedule a time to meet (virtual or in-person) and chat.</li>
				<em><li style="color:#800000; list-style-type:square;"><b>Please note, I apologize in advance for any delays in my response.</b></em>
				</li>
